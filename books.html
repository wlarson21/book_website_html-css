		<article class="first">
			<p> Listed below are some of the most influential and useful books I have come across. There are both non-fiction and fiction books but both have shaped how I think. If you think you would also love these books, simply click on the picture and it will take you to <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> where you will be able to purchase these books.</p>

			<a target="_blank" href= "https://www.amazon.com/Shoulders-Giants-Nicolaus-Copernicus/dp/076241698X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1532293507&sr=8-1&keywords=on+the+shoulders+of+giants"><img src="img/giants.jpg" title="giants.jpg" alt= "On The Shoulders of Giants" /> </a>
			<p> On the Shoulders of Giants was the first non-fiction book I ever purchased. This book walks you through the great accomplishments of some of the top historical physicists. Throughout the book it is shown how the ideas of each generation builds on the generation that comes before them. It also includes exerts from each of the historical figures own works.</p>

			<a target="_blank" href= "https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Collectible-Trunk-Like-Decorative/dp/B018IL7AQY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1532304070&sr=8-3&keywords=harry+potter+book+set"><img src="img/Harry_Potter.jpg" title="Harry_Potter.jpg" alt= "Harry Potter Box Set" /></a>
			<p> The Harry Potter series is one of the best known series of my generation. Through 7 books you get the normal action, adventure and magic that you expect from the fantasy genre but you also get to watch the main character grow up and deal with the same problems that normal kids do. In addition it places great emphasis on learning, both book and street smarts.</p>

			<a target="_blank" href= "https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Materials-Science-Engineering-Registration/dp/1119230403/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=58ARJ8PDGKFRN2V9TV5A"><img src="img/material_science.jpg" title="c_programming.jpg" alt= "Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering" /></a>
			<p>Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering was the required text book for my introduction to material science course. In that course I used the book a grand total of 3 times. But because of the fact that it is both well written and well laid out, every class and job I have taken since I have constantly found myself referring back to it. </p>
